# Agent Rules

A collection of reusable rules and knowledge documents for AI coding assistants like Claude Code and Cursor.

## Why This Format?

This repository uses the `.mdc` (Markdown with Configuration) format, which provides a unified approach that works seamlessly with both Claude Code and Cursor:

- **Cursor** natively supports `.mdc` files with YAML frontmatter for rule configuration
- **Claude Code** reads the markdown content, ignoring the frontmatter metadata
- The YAML frontmatter provides optional metadata (description, file globs, alwaysApply) that Cursor uses for intelligent rule application
- Standard markdown content ensures compatibility across different AI assistants

This unified format means you can use the same rule files in both tools without modification.

## Usage

### For Cursor Users
1. Copy any `.mdc` file from `project-rules/` to your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. Cursor will automatically apply rules based on the glob patterns in the frontmatter
3. Rules with `alwaysApply: true` will be active for all files
4. Documentation from `docs/` can be referenced or imported as needed

### For Claude Code Users
1. Copy the content of any `.mdc` file (excluding the frontmatter) into your `CLAUDE.md` file
2. Or reference the entire file using the `@import` syntax in your `CLAUDE.md`
3. Place in your project root or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for global rules
4. Both project rules and documentation can be included

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute your own rules! Please ensure they:
1. Use the `.mdc` extension
2. Include proper YAML frontmatter with `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply` fields
3. Contain clear, actionable instructions
4. Are generic enough to be reused across projects
5. Are placed in the appropriate directory:
   - `project-rules/` for actionable AI assistant rules
   - `docs/` for reference documentation
