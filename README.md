A comprehensive rule for creating well-structured GitHub issues from feature descriptions. This rule guides AI assistants through a 5-step process:

1. **Research the repository** - Examines existing issues, documentation, and contribution guidelines
2. **Research best practices** - Studies current standards and examples from popular projects
3. **Present a plan** - Outlines the proposed issue structure with labels and milestones
4. **Create the issue** - Drafts complete issue content with title, description, and acceptance criteria
5. **Final output** - Provides ready-to-use GitHub issue content

**Usage**: Add the content from `github-issue-creation.md` to your global or project-specific CLAUDE.md file.

**Location**: [`github-issue-creation.md`](./github-issue-creation.md)
